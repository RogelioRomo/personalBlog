## Starting a new game journey

Kingdome Come: Deliverance II recently came out, and apparently it's a really
good contender for GOTY. So for this reason I am giving it a try with the studio's
first game to see what the story is about and so far it's been a great experience.
I'll see if I finish it or not because I've never played a 50+ hour long rpg game.
