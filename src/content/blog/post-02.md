## A little introduction

<br/>

I've been curious about learning Linux, of course on the entry level, I'm not to interested
on deep Linux administration tasks. I am interested on setting up Linux servers, but right
now its not my focus. So I figured the best way to experience the environment was to installing
it on a Laptop I have that was just collecting dust. So thats what I did, I uninstalled Windows
and selected a famous distro called Linux Mint.

<br/>

## Why Linux Mint?

<br/>

Well, the quick answer is just is simplicity, it's good for begginer Linux users, and it is
a estable distro with a large community. I wanted a distro that was not that complicated to use
since I'm planning to stay in that distro for a few years, if I were to choose something like Arch
I could have problems that would just ruined my first impressions and experience, so I just decided
to choose Linux Mint between all the options. Also, not forgetting one of the reasons is that Mint
is based on Debian, which is, for what I understand, a really good estable Linux environment with huge
documentations and support.

<br/>

## So how has my experience been

<br/>

So far it's been great! One of the reason I wanted to try Linux is because I really believe is the
best OS out there for development in general. Why? for me theres two main reasons, the shell and the
available software, packages, libraries, etc for Linux.

<br/>

Generally, Unix based shells have superpowers compared to the ones on Windows for example. There are
of course many of them, but the two I have use are 'bash' and 'zsh', the second one having even more
options for the file searching and other things. Both are great, and both are always in the top options
when you want to install a package for Linux or even any development library or framework out there.

<br/>

Also, when you have a powerful shell like that, you can end up using development tools like VIM or EMACS
in a more advance way comparing it to Windows. By the way, I plan to to add a post on EMACS and comparing
it to Neovim, but that will come later this month. I'm still learning EMACS so its now quite the time yet.

<br/>

About the second point on why I things its a better OS for development. When you have been developing
projects, you end up encountering problems related with Windows specifically, meaning you have to go
around and look for solutions on the internet to make a package work or to twick the performance.

<br/>

On the other hand, you also encounter software that is not available on Windows and that you really
want to use for a project or even if you just want to learn how to use it. But with Linux, its actually
the opposite, commonly packages are develop in a Unix/Linux environment, so once the author finishes
the package its already released on Linux. Even if the package is not even developed on Linux, authors
commonly release Linux versions at the launch of their project because theres a huge demand for it.

<br/>

On a less serious topic, I also love the way you can freely customize you Linux enviroment the way you
want, with not a lot of limitations. I'm currently running the Cinammon version of Linux Mint and it
looks so good, just the way I like it.

<br/>

## I'm done with Windows?

<br/>

Well, I will still be using Windows, because is installed on my main computer, and I have a lot of
things set up, and videogames, that I am not willing to change to Linux. So for the tasks like learnig
new stuff developmentwise, I will use the laptop. This way I can keep using both OS's without limiting
myself to just one.
